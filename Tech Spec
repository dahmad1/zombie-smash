*if during playtesting the game is too easy or impossible, change the numbers a bit

Zombies:
have zombies use the given sprite
for every frame check the if position of the zombie overlaps with a player
      if yes, then subtract the damage of the zombie from the hp of the player every 2 seconds
      if no, add zombie speed to position in direction of player position
Spawn by creating new object like the meteors from spaceship
pick random position on map to spawn

Also check if a player bullet or melee weapon is overlapping with the zombie, and if so subtract the damage from the health
if a zombie's health reaches 0 or below, play the given sfx and turn the zombie red for 2 frame before removing it
when a zombie dies, randomly determine based on 10% chance whether dna drop boolean true
if true then make smaller object appear where zombie died that will increment player DNA count upon collision and disappear
      when player purchases luck upgrades, change drop chance as specified

Head Honcho:
spawn zombie, but with specified changes to numbers
every 10 seconds randomly check to spawn 5 zombies around head HONCHO
    if yes, spawn 5 zombies with positions that are slightly changed from head honcho's current position
when head honcho health reaches 0 or below, set all other zombie health to 0
    end the game with a win screen adapted from loss screen of spaceship game

Player:
For movement take controls from the spaceship for turning, and just adapt from forward movement to make strafing also possible
The bullet attack can also be taken from the spaceship program
sword attacks will extend out in a cone for 1 frame when attack is pressed
flamethrower will extend in a cone as long as the attack button is held down, decrementing ammo
these movement methods can be adapted to all entities, zombies and players alike, to keep it simple
player death(s) = loss screen from spaceship game

Achievements:
when menu key pressed, set speed of all active objects to 0 and create text with menu options
    use a clear color for text
find online how to implement clicking
    when achievements clicked from menu bring up a list of achievements that are a different color when completed
keep variables that increment based on what player does
when variables reach certain number it will turn boolean achievement unlocked to true
when boolean becomes true, show text in top right corner: "(achievement name) Unlocked!"

Research screen:
When wave ends, bring up research screen based on concept sketch
use the clicking implemented above
with each purchased thing add to player
*this may take a long while to program and idk how to implement it
